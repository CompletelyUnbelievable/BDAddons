This was the first theme of The Revitalization Project. Due to the consistant changes to the GuildsWrapper, Variable Server Grid is now depricated. I'm gonna give them time to figure things out before I update it again.

# VariableServerGrid

<div>I took inspiriation from Jikks' ServerGrid theme, I updated it and gave the theme new features. This theme allows the user to select how many columns of guild the user wants through a css variable in the theme file. Works with the public guilds button and the read all notifications plugin. <em>This is the live version, check the previous updates folder for non-live versions.</em></div>
