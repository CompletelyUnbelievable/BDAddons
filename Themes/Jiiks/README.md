# VariableServerGrid

<div>I took inspiriation from Jikks' ServerGrid theme, I updated it and gave the theme new features. This theme allows the user to select how many columns of guild the user wants through a css variable in the theme file. Works with the public guilds button and the read all notifications plugin. <em>This is the live version, check the previous updates folder for non-live versions.</em></div>
