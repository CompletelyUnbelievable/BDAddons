The light and dark exclusive style sheets are meant to be imported or copied by developers, but the imported filename in the theme file can be changed so that any of these can be imported.

Change the line that says:

@import url("https://completelyunbelievable.github.io/TransparencyQuick/Import/TransparencyQuick.css");

Change the "TransparencyQuick.css" portion at the end to either "TransparencyQuickDark.css" or "TransparencyQuickLight.css" to get said desired effect.
