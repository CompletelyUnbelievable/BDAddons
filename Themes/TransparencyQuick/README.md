# TransparencyQuick
A better discord theme to allow for an image background to be used without much effort.

I created it a while ago so that I could view themes that wouldn't even work with the themefixer. Requires Zerebos TransparencyPatcher plugin to get full window transparency, works great with wallpaper engine when using the plugin.
