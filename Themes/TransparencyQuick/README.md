A better discord theme to allow for an image background to be used without much effort.

I created it a while ago so that I could view themes that wouldn't even work with the themefixer. Does not touch dropdown menus, scrollbars, and hovered elements. This is on purpose, and intended so that it does not mess with other theme styles if at all possible. Bad coding on someone else's end can cause an issue where these styles may or may not take precedent when they should or should not be occurring.
