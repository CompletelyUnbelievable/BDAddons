# Anti-light theme

<em>Depricated, use the plugin instead.</em>

A Better Discord theme intended to replace the light theme with the dark theme in the appearance menu.

There are two potential uses of Anti-Light which will vary depending on if it is supported:
<ul><li>Allows the user to swap between a 'Main Theme' for a given BD theme and a normal looking 'Dark' theme from the appearance menu.</li><li>Make it so that no matter what appearance setting for the theme is selected, a theme will look the same in both.</li></ul>

The compatibility of Anti-Light, given it being used with another theme, can be rather complex. The former requires that the other theme only makes major modifications to the dark theme; while the latter only requires that the other theme does not make any major changes exclusive to the light theme.
