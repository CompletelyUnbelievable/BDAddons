# Experimental plugins

<div>This is a place for my proof of concept plugins, a place for plugins not meant to be used by the general populace yet. They will have some issues, they will almost certainly be inefficient, and they will be updated at random or not at all, but you can try them if you would like.</div>

# FixDiscordImages plugin [Discontinued]

<div>Forces certain areas of the home menu to load full sized images instead of the cropped ones. The menu also just uses some bad images, which are not remedied by this plugin. This will probably be outdated and/or deprecated soon due to the activity menu changes that are currently on Canary, and quite possibly on PTB.</div>

# FurryTalk plugin

<div>Makes the text in the chat area appear to be something similar to furry roleplay, does not change anything a user sends. Someone requested a plugin the does the same thing as a certain chrome extension but for discord. I thought it would be a nice concept for practice, and there arenâ€™t that many goofy plugins that do something absurd. In all honesty, more people were disturbed by it.</div>

# GuildSettingsClasses plugin

<div>Someone was having an issue with having icons next to the tabs of both the settings menu and the guild settings menu, this plugin adds classes based on the name of those tabs so they can show up correctly.</div>

# RevealSpoilers plugin [Discontinued]

<div>Just use either <a href="https://github.com/mwittrien/BetterDiscordAddons/blob/master/Plugins/RevealAllSpoilersOption/RevealAllSpoilersOption.plugin.js">Devilbro's Reveal All Spoilers Option plugin</a> or <a href="https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/RevealSpoilers">Zerebro's plugin of the same name</a>.

# StartingVolume plugin

<div>My most prospective plugin. Sets Discord's native video/audio embeds play at 10% volume from the start. SoundCloud embeds are also supported. Modify the volumes individually in the settings panel.</div>

# VCButton plugin

<div>The name is a WIP. This plugin is intended to be used as an alternative to the discord expiriments plugin for streaming or watching streams in a guild (server) voice channel. This plugin should be less likely to cause issue b/c it does not set your client into the developer mode that the discord expiriments plugin does.</div>
