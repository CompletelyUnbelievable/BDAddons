# Plugins

<div>This is a place for my proof of concept plugins, a place for plugins not meant to be used by the general populace yet.</div>

# AntiLight plugin

<div>Don't use it. This plugin was just attempting to do what my old theme of the same name did, but less crap.</div>

# FixDiscordImages plugin

<div>Forces certain areas of the home menu to load full sized images instead of the cropped ones. The menu also just uses some bad images, which are not remedied by this plugin.</div>

# FurryTalk plugin

<div>Makes the text in the chat area appear to be something similar to furry roleplay, does not change anything a user sends. Someone requested a plugin the does the same thing as a chrome extension but for discord. I thought it would be a nice concept for practice, and there arenâ€™t that many goofy plugins that do something absurd. A lot more people were disturbed by it though.</div>

# GuildSettingsClasses plugin

<div>Someone was having an issue with having icons next to the tabs of both the settings menu and the guild settings menu, this plugin adds classes based on the name of those tabs so they can show up correctly.</div>

# RevealSpoilers plugin

<div>Just use <a href="https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordAddons/tree/master/Plugins/RevealSpoilers">Zerebro's plugin of the same name</a>, my plugin works but Zere's does it better.

# StartingVolume plugin

<div>Makes native discord embeds for audio and video start at 10% of their normal volume. I don't know what discord was thinking having their native embeds play at 100% volume right from the start.</div>
